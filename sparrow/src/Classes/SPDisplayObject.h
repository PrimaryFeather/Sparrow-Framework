/** ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 The SPDisplayObject class is the base class for all objects that are rendered on the screen.
 
 In Sparrow, all displayable objects are organized in a display tree. Only objects that are part of
 the display tree will be displayed (rendered). 
 
 The display tree consists of leaf nodes (SPImage, SPQuad) that will be rendered directly to
 the screen, and of container nodes (subclasses of SPDisplayObjectContainer, like SPSprite).
 A container is simply a display object that has child nodes - which can, again, be either leaf
 nodes or other containers. 
 
 At the root of the display tree, there is the SPStage, which is a container, too. To create a
 Sparrow application, you let your main class inherit from SPStage, and build up your display
 tree from there.
 
 A display object has properties that define its position in relation to its parent
 (`x`, `y`), as well as its rotation and scaling factors (`scaleX`, `scaleY`). Use the `alpha` and
 `visible` properties to make an object translucent or invisible.
 
 Every display object may be the target of touch events. If you don't want an object to be
 touchable, you can disable the `touchable` property. When it's disabled, neither the object
 nor its children will receive any more touch events.
 
 *Points vs. Pixels*
 
 All sizes and distances are measured in points. What this means in pixels depends on the 
 contentScaleFactor of the stage. On a low resolution device (up to iPhone 3GS), one point is one
 pixel. On devices with a retina display, one point may be 2 pixels.
 
 *Transforming coordinates*
 
 Within the display tree, each object has its own local coordinate system. If you rotate a container,
 you rotate that coordinate system - and thus all the children of the container.
 
 Sometimes you need to know where a certain point lies relative to another coordinate system. 
 That's the purpose of the method `transformationMatrixToSpace:`. It will create a matrix that
 represents the transformation of a point in one coordinate system to another. 
 
 *Subclassing SPDisplayObject*
 
 As SPDisplayObject is an abstract class, you can't instantiate it directly, but have to use one of 
 its subclasses instead. There are already a lot of them available, and most of the time they will
 suffice. 
 
 However, you can create custom subclasses as well. That's especially useful when you want to 
 create an object with a custom render function.
 
 You will need to implement the following methods when you subclass SPDisplayObject:
 
	- (void)render:(SPRenderSupport*)support;
	- (SPRectangle*)boundsInSpace:(SPDisplayObject*)targetCoordinateSpace;
 
 Have a look at SPQuad for a sample implementation of those methods.
