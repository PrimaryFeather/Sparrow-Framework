/** ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 An SPMovieClip is a simple way to display an animation depicted by a number of textures.

 You can add the frames one by one or pass them all at once (in an array) at initialization time.
 The movie clip will have the width and height of the first frame.
 
 At initialization, you can specify the desired framerate. You can, however, manually give each
 frame a custom duration. You can also play a sound whenever a certain frame appears.
 
 The methods `play` and `pause` control playback of the movie. You will receive an event of type
 `SP_EVENT_TYPE_MOVIE_COMPLETED` when the movie finished playback. When the movie is looping,
 the event is dispatched once per loop.
 
 As any animated object, a movie clip has to be added to a juggler (or have its `advanceTime:` 
 method called regularly) to run.
