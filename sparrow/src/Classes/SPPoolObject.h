/** ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 The SPPoolObject class is an alternative to the base class `NSObject` that manages a pool of 
 objects.
 
 Subclasses of SPPoolObject do not deallocate object instances when the retain counter reaches
 zero. Instead, the objects stay in memory and will be re-used when a new instance of the object
 is requested. That way, object initialization is accelerated. You can release the memory of all 
 recycled objects anytime by calling the `purgePool` method.
 
 Sparrow uses this class for `SPPoint`, `SPRectangle` and `SPMatrix`, as they are created very often 
 as helper objects.
 
 To use memory pooling for another class, you just have to inherit from SPPoolObject and implement
 the following method:
 
 	+ (SPPoolInfo *) poolInfo
 	{
 	    static SPPoolInfo poolInfo;
 	    return &poolInfo;
 	}
