The scaffold project is configured with the setting "doubleOnPad". This means that the scale
factors have the following meaning:

- 1x: standard iPhone (320x480)
- 2x: retina iPhone (640x960), standard iPad (768x1024)
- 4x: retina iPad (1536x2048)

To keep the download small, the scaffold only contains '1x' and '2x' textures; but this folder
would be a good place for your retina graphics.
