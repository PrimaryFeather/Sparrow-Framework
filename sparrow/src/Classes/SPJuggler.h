 The SPJuggler takes objects that implement SPAnimatable (e.g. `SPTween`s) and executes them.
 
 A juggler is a simple object. It does no more than saving a list of objects implementing 
 `SPAnimatable` and advancing their time if it is told to do so (by calling its own `advanceTime:`
 method). When an animation is completed, it throws it away.
 
 There is a default juggler in every stage. You can access it by calling
 
	SPJuggler *juggler = [SPStage mainStage].juggler;
 
 in any object that has access to the stage. You can, however, create juggler objects yourself, too.
 That way, you can group your game into logical components that handle their animations independently.
 
 A cool feature of the juggler is to delay method calls. Say you want to remove an object from its
 parent 2 seconds from now. Call:

	[[juggler delayInvocationAtTarget:object byTime:2.0] removeFromParent];
 
 This line of code will execute the following method 2 seconds in the future:

 	[object removeFromParent];
