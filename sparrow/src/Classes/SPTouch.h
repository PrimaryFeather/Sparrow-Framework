/** ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 An SPTouch contains information about the presence or movement of a finger on the screen.
 
 You receive objects of this type via an SPTouchEvent. When such an event is triggered, you can 
 query it for all touches that are currently present on the screen. One SPTouch object contains
 information about a single touch.
 
 **The phase of a touch**
 
 Each touch normally moves through the following phases in its life:
 
 `Began -> Moved -> Ended`
 
 Furthermore, a touch can enter a <code>STATIONARY</code> phase. That phase does not
 trigger a touch event itself, and it can only occur when 'Multitouch' is activated. Picture a 
 situation where one finger is moving and the other is stationary. A touch event will
 be dispatched only to the object under the _moving_ finger. In the list of touches of
 that event, you will find the second touch in the stationary phase.
 
 **The position of a touch**
 
 You can get the current and last position on the screen with corresponding properties. However, 
 you'll want to have the position in a different coordinate system most of the time. 
 For this reason, there are methods that convert the current and previous touches into the local
 coordinate system of any object.
