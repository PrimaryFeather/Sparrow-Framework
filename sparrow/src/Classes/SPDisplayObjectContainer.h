/** ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 An SPDisplayObjectContainer represents a collection of display objects.
 
 It is the base class of all display objects that act as a container for other objects. By 
 maintaining an ordered list of children, it defines the back-to-front positioning of the children
 within the display tree.
 
 A container does not have size in itself. The width and height properties represent the extents
 of its children. Changing those properties will scale all children accordingly.
 
 As this is an abstract class, you can't instantiate it directly, but have to 
 use a subclass instead. The most lightweight container class is SPSprite.
 
 *Adding and removing children*
 
 The class defines methods that allow you to add or remove children. When you add a child, it will
 be added at the foremost position, possibly occluding a child that was added before. You can access
 the children via an index. The first child will have index 0, the second child index 1, etc. 
 
 Adding and removing objects from a container triggers non-bubbling events.
 
 - `SP_EVENT_TYPE_ADDED`: the object was added to a parent.
 - `SP_EVENT_TYPE_ADDED_TO_STAGE`: the object was added to a parent that is connected to the stage,
                                   thus becoming visible now.
 - `SP_EVENT_TYPE_REMOVED`: the object was removed from a parent.
 - `SP_EVENT_TYPE_REMOVED_FROM_STAGE`: the object was removed from a parent that is connected to 
                                       the stage, thus becoming invisible now.
 
 Especially the `ADDED_TO_STAGE` event is very helpful, as it allows you to automatically execute
 some logic (e.g. start an animation) when an object is rendered the first time.
